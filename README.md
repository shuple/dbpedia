# Query DBpedia
As I go through a SPARQL text, I've been adapting the example queries to focus on 'DBpedia,' making the learning process even more engaging, at least for me.

## Installation
Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuple/query-dbpedia
```

## Usage
Copy and paste the query on the sample directory on https://dbpedia.org/sparql.\
If you prefer a command line, there is a Python CLI companion for effortless SPARQL endpoint and RDF file interactions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuple/sparqly
python3 sparqly/sparql_query.py query-dbpedia/sample/object.rq
```
